  <article class="work-body poem">

    <h2>Dedication</h2>
    <p>
To my children, bearers of the name HITH.
I leave you these words not as philosophy, but as fragments of my heart.
They are reflections, memories, and stories that once lived in me.
Some may sound like lessons, some like dreams,
but together they form the path I wish for you — and for all who read them.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a Philosopher</h2>
    <p>
I am not a philosopher.
I do not wear the robe of great thinkers,
nor do I claim wisdom higher than another’s.
But a mother reflects, even when she does not intend to.
My reflections are mine — born, lived, and gone by me.
You may agree, or you may not.
Still, the thought has already passed.
My mind is mine, your mind is yours.
And this is freedom: to walk together without thinking alike.
    </p>

    <h2>Memories and Decisions</h2>
    <p>
Memories are fragile: they can warm you,
or they can haunt you until you fear even the day.
They are built from yesterday,
and yesterday is carved from today’s decisions.
Regret makes a nightmare.
Acceptance makes wisdom.
So make your choices with courage,
and when you fall, rise without shame.
    </p>

    <h2>Footprints</h2>
    <p>
Every step leaves a trace —
some on sand, some on stone.
Some fade quickly, some remain.
What matters is not where they fall,
but that you dared to walk.
And remember:
your footprints belong not only to you.
The earth remembers,
your children remember,
and one day, your story will walk on without you.
    </p>

    <h2>Empire from the Bed</h2>
    <p>
Once I dreamt of a mother, bed-bound by illness.
Her body was frail, yet her spirit vast.
From her bed she gave instructions,
imagined gardens, paths, walls, and a home so wide it seemed an empire.
Her children grew into kings and queens,
walking proudly upon the land she built without rising once.
Strength is not always in the hands that work —
sometimes it is in the heart that dares to dream.
    </p>

    <h2>First Days in Italy</h2>
    <p>
I arrived with wide eyes and an open heart.
No roosters, no dust, no familiar rhythms —
only polished streets and voices like music I could not yet sing.
I was a stranger, learning to belong.
And I learned this: even when the world feels foreign,
you must plant your feet and claim the ground as yours.
    </p>

    <h2>Lessons of Courtesy</h2>
    <p>
Once, a neighbour stopped me as I passed his gate.
“You did not greet properly,” he said.
Three times I had to curtsy, until it was right.
It was not laughter, but lesson:
respect is not performance,
it is posture —
an unseen crown you wear before the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Ananse’s Web</h2>
    <p>
I carry with me the tales of Ananse,
the spider who tricked and taught in equal measure.
He feigned death to be buried among yams,
then rose at night to steal the harvest.
He married for the season and left when the work was done.
From him I learned:
cleverness without honour is a trap,
and the web that ensnares others
will one day entangle its weaver.
    </p>

    <h2>The Weight of Freedom</h2>
    <p>
Freedom is not light — it is heavy.
To think for yourself,
to walk your own path,
to choose and accept the cost.
But it is a holy weight,
and one worth carrying.
For in freedom, you learn not who others expect you to be,
but who you truly are.
    </p>

    <h2>Roots and Wings</h2>
    <p>
Carry your roots with pride —
they are the soil of who you are.
But never believe you must choose between them.
You belong to two great halves,
and together they make you the greatest whole.
One root runs deep in the land of your fathers,
the other holds firm in the land where you rise.
One speaks to you in stories and traditions,
the other in lessons and new beginnings.
They are not rivals, but harmony —
two streams flowing into the same river.
And you are that river,
broad, strong, unstoppable.
Not half of anything,
but the fullness of both.
    </p>

    <h2>Strength in Difference</h2>
    <p>
You are not called to think alike.
Difference is not division,
but a gift that keeps us awake.
Let each mind be free,
and each soul walk its own way —
side by side, not identical,
but together in respect.
    </p>

    <h2>The Quiet Power of Love</h2>
    <p>
Love is not always loud.
It does not always command or demand.
Sometimes it is presence in the room,
a whisper in the night,
a thought that lingers years later.
That is the kind of love I leave you.
Not grand, not loud —
but steady, eternal,
woven into every breath you take.
    </p>

    <h2>The Legacy</h2>
    <p>
This, my children, is my legacy.
Not philosophy, not doctrine, not law —
only the voice of a mother,
soft, imperfect, and true.
Carry it with you.
Let it remind you always:
you are the bearers of HITH.
