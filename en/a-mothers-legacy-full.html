<p><strong>Dedication</strong></p>

To my children, bearers of the name HITH.  
I leave you these words not as philosophy, but as fragments of my heart.  
They are reflections, memories, and stories that once lived in me.  
Some may sound like lessons, others like dreams,  
but together they form the path I wish for you — and for anyone who reads them.



<p><strong>Not a Philosopher</strong></p>

I am not a philosopher.  
I do not wear the robe of great thinkers,  
nor do I claim wisdom higher than another’s.  
But a mother reflects, even without meaning to.  
My reflections are mine — born, lived, and already passed through me.  
You may agree or not.  
The thought has already flown.  
My mind is mine, your mind is yours.  
And that is freedom: walking together without thinking the same.



<p><strong>Memories and Decisions</strong></p>

Memories are fragile:  
they can warm you,  
or haunt you until even daylight feels heavy.  
They are born from yesterday,  
and yesterday is shaped by today’s choices.  
Regret creates nightmares.  
Acceptance creates wisdom.  
So choose with courage —  
and when you fall, rise without shame.



<p><strong>Footprints</strong></p>

Every step leaves a trace —  
some in sand, some in stone.  
Some fade quickly, others remain.  
What matters is not where they fall,  
but that you dared to walk.  
And remember:  
your footprints do not belong only to you.  
The earth remembers,  
your children remember,  
and one day your story will walk on without you.



<p><strong>Empire from the Bed</strong></p>

Once I dreamt of a mother, bound to her bed by illness.  
Her body fragile, her spirit vast.  
From her bed she gave directions,  
imagining gardens, paths, walls,  
a home so wide it felt like an empire.  
Her children grew into kings and queens,  
walking proudly on the land she built without standing once.  
Strength is not always in the hands that work —  
sometimes it is in the heart that dares to dream.



<p><strong>First Days in Italy</strong></p>

I arrived with wide eyes and an open heart.  
No roosters, no dust, no familiar rhythm —  
only polished streets and voices like music  
I did not yet know how to sing.  
I was a stranger learning to belong.  
And I learned this:  
even when the world feels foreign,  
you must plant your feet  
and claim the ground as yours.



<p><strong>Lessons of Courtesy</strong></p>

Once, a neighbor stopped me at his gate.  
“You did not greet properly,” he said.  
Three times I had to bow, until it was right.  
It was not mockery — it was lesson.  
Respect is not performance,  
it is posture,  
an invisible crown you wear before the world.



<p><strong>Ananse’s Web</strong></p>

I carry with me the stories of Ananse,  
the spider who tricked and taught in equal measure.  
He pretended to die to be buried among yams,  
then rose at night to steal the harvest.  
He married for a season and left when the work was done.  
From him I learned:  
cleverness without honour is a trap,  
and the web that ensnares others  
will one day entangle the one who wove it.



<p><strong>The Weight of Freedom</strong></p>

Freedom is not light — it is heavy.  
To think for yourself,  
to walk your own path,  
to choose and bear the cost.  
But it is a sacred weight,  
and worth carrying.  
Because in freedom  
you discover not who others expect you to be,  
but who you truly are.



<p><strong>Roots and Wings</strong></p>

Carry your roots with pride —  
they are the soil of who you are.  
But never believe you must choose between them.  
You belong to two great halves,  
and together they form the greatest whole.  
One root lies deep in the land of your fathers,  
the other holds firm in the land where you rise.  
One speaks in stories and traditions,  
the other in lessons and new beginnings.  
They are not rivals, but harmony —  
two streams flowing into the same river.  
And you are that river:  
broad, strong, unstoppable.  
Not half of something,  
but the fullness of both.



<p><strong>Strength in Difference</strong></p>

You are not meant to think the same.  
Difference is not division —  
it is a gift that keeps us awake.  
Let each mind be free,  
and each soul walk its own path —  
side by side, not identical,  
but together in respect.



<p><strong>The Quiet Power of Love</strong></p>

Love is not always loud.  
It does not always command or demand.  
Sometimes it is presence in a room,  
a whisper in the night,  
a thought that lingers years later.  
That is the love I leave you.  
Not grand, not loud —  
but steady, eternal,  
woven into every breath.



<p><strong>The Legacy</strong></p>

This, my children, is my legacy.  
Not philosophy, not doctrine, not law —  
only the voice of a mother,  
soft, imperfect, and true.  
Carry it with you.  
Let it remind you always:  
you are the bearers of HITH.
